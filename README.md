# Krita Brush Info

Krita Brush Info is a C# Windows application that reads Krita brush configurations and displays them in a readable form. It can also compare two brushes and show the differences. This can be useful for seeing the structure of the brush parameters and to easily compare the differences between two brushes. It is easier to compare brushes this way than by hunting through the brush properties dialog in Krita, and it may give you some insight into how Krita brushes are configured.

It can read .kpp brush preset files or get them from a .bundle resource bundle.
